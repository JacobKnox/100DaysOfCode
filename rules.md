# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour a day for 100 total days.*

#### Start Date
February 1st, 2023

## Additional Rules
1. I will post about my progress every day using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge. However, I will count time spent on course-related coding, especially FSC File Share and the Palace mobile app.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the [log](https://github.com/JacobKnox/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
