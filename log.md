# 100 Days Of Code
## Day 1 - February 1st, 2023
&emsp;&emsp;I coded for around 30 minutes from 11:45 AM to 12:15 PM EST and pushed changes to my Discord bot changing the !pnwraw and !pnwmanu resources to default to "all" which returns statistics about all raw/manu resources. [Commit](https://github.com/JacobKnox/Personal-Discord-Bot/commit/61af30bed1bdaee05734e8b51f82c3312b381bdf)

&emsp;&emsp;Spent roughly 20 minutes from 12:50 to 1:10 PM EST to make the !ban command functional and usable. Also fixed an issue where certain command errors would spam my DMs and a certain command error would be sent to my DMs when it didn't need to be.
